# SingleImageSuperResolution

## Dataset (DIV2K)

For training the DIV2k dataset was used, as it contains high resolution images of landscapes, humans, achitecture and more... <br />
Therefore it should work best on a wide spectrum of applications.

"The DIV2K dataset is one of the most popular datasets used for image super-resolution, which is collected for NTIRE2017 and NTIRE2018 Super-Resolution Challenges. The dataset is composed of 800 images for training, 100 images for validation, and 100 images for testing. Each image has a 2K resolution." - [Medium](https://openmmlab.medium.com/awesome-datasets-for-super-resolution-introduction-and-pre-processing-55f8501f8b18)
